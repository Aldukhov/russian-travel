                    <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM surveys, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
                        but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their home country.
                        They say, why travel at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south,
                        dense forests of Sayan, and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau.
                        And you can see all these beauties without millions in your account,
                        a passport, and hours of flights. Like, for example,
                        Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children in tow,
                        put them in her "Lada" and drove 20,000 kilometers across her native country.
                        We have selected and described some interesting places worth your vacation.</p>

                                Primarily because of the mountains: if you travel along the ridge,
                                you will see slopes covered with pines, mountain rivers, and lakes.
                                And if you open the car windows, you can get acquainted
                                with the invisible wonder of these places - mountain air.

                                The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to travel here in the summer.
                                That way, you'll see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna.
                                Moose roam through the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains.
                                And the famous Pallas's cats are also residents of the Altai Territory.

                                This is a sport where a skier attaches themselves
                                to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to achieve the highest possible speed on the ice.
                                In March 2019, at the "Baikal Mile" festival, a world record was set - 197.011 km/h.
